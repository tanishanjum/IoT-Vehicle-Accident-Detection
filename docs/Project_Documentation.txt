IoT-Based Automatic Vehicle Accident Detection and Rescue System

1. Introduction
Accidents occur frequently, and reducing response time can save lives. This project aims to develop an IoT-based accident detection and rescue system that automatically detects accidents and alerts emergency contacts. The system integrates sensors with a microcontroller and uses GSM and GPS modules to send real-time alerts.

2. Features
âœ… Accident Detection: Detects collisions using an accelerometer & gyroscope (MPU6050).
âœ… Real-Time Location Tracking: Sends GPS coordinates of the accident location.
âœ… Automated Alert System: Sends SMS alerts via GSM 800L module.
âœ… Emergency Contact Notification: Notifies predefined contacts with location details.

3. Components Used
Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)

MPU6050 (Accelerometer + Gyroscope)

GPS NEO-6M (Location Tracking)

GSM 800L Module (For SMS Alerts)

12V Battery (Power Supply)

Buzzer (For Local Alert)

4. Working Principle
Data Collection:

The MPU6050 sensor continuously monitors vehicle acceleration and angular velocity.

Sudden changes beyond a threshold indicate a possible accident.

Accident Detection:

If a crash is detected, the Arduino processes the data and triggers an emergency response.

Location Tracking & Alert:

The GPS module collects the real-time location of the accident.

The GSM module sends an SMS alert to predefined emergency contacts, including location details.

Buzzer Activation:

The system activates a buzzer as a local alert for nearby people to assist immediately.
